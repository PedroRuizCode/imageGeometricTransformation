# imageGeometricTransformation
Algorithm to carry out the transformation by similarity and affine to an image.

The algorithm asks the user to select three points on 2 images to calculate the affine transformation matrix and performs the transformation. Then, from the generated matrix, it calculates the rotation, translation and scaling values to carry out the transformation by similarity of the image. At the end, all the images generated are shown.
